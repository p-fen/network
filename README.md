# network
Got starter code for a simple neural network for handwritten digit recognition in Python and played around with various ways to improve it. Added layers and neurons and layers as well as trying functions that made the learning rate decay as iterations progressed. Additionally messed around with expanding the MNIST data set I used by adding in rotated versions of the images.
